# sql-challenge

In this challenge, I am asked to create a logic table using https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/. It's key for us to
order the tables to create the PKs before their FKs and to have for all the columns of the tables to have the proper 
variable types. My results for this portion of the project can be observed in employee-schemata.sql and 
employee-logic-diagram.png.

Once I created the tables and imported the data, I worked on 8 queries. You will see the SQL code for my work in 
employee-sql-master-code.sql. Additionally, I provided CSV files that display the results of my queries. For the sake, 
of the assignemnt, I printed the first 20 results if their were too many results.
